summary: How it all began. Introducing myself and my story so far

Picture this: it's late at night, and as a child,
you're huddled under your blanket with a small gaming console in hand,
absorbed in the digital world unfolding before you.
That was me, captivated by the magic of technology from a young age.
Little did I know, that fascination would lead me on a thrilling journey
into the heart of computing. Tag along.

I've been fascinated with technology from a young age. From small gaming consoles like BrickGame to remote controlled toy cars, I enjoyed them all.
From playong with them and taking them apart to try and see the magic going on, I couldn't get enough.

While watching the TV series "Scorpion," I found myself captivated by Walter's remarkable computing skills.
As I observed him typing furiously into a computer amidst a crisis, I couldn't help but wonder, "What's he doing?" Moments later, he came up with a brilliant solution, igniting my curiosity and prompting me to embark on a series of Google searches about software.

Around then my brother had just joined the university and now had a laptop. His laptop became not just a tool for his university studies, but also a portal for me to dive into the world of coding. With his encouragement and guidance, I took my first steps into the world of software development.

After writing my first line of code, yes you guessed it right, a hello-world program in Python, I was hooked. What do you mean I can type some characters and this console will do something? This was an 'aha!' moment for me. I knew then this is what I wanted to do and my journey into software began.

My recent endeavors have led me to the realm of web developmment, getting to gain a deeper understanding of the internet and the technologies that power the modern web.

Applying my new skills, I built my first project, [VChat](https://vchat-messenger.vercel.app). It's a realtime chat messaging app.Built with [React](https://react.dev/) and [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/) as the cloud platform.

Initially, VChat began as a personal hobbyâ€”a whimsical platform where I amused myself with goofy texts. However, to my surprise, it has evolved into much more. Presently, hundreds of users from across the globe have signed up and actively engage with the platform. The influx of users has come with a wave of feature requests, driving me to continually enhance and refine the application. Stay tuned for an upcoming post detailing the evolution and development process of VChat.

I am enjoying thus chapter of my journey so far and I can't wait to see what the future holds! Drop a comment below and let's start a conversation.
