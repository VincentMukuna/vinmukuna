This is a feature-rich chat application built with React, Appwrite, Chakra UI and other modern technologies.
The app allows users to engage in real-time messaging, create and manage group chats, update their profiles, and more.

Feature requests are also promptly handled.

The app has a 'Main Lobby' where every user is added as they join. Here you can connect with other users, report bugs or request for features. I am actively developing this project with new cool features.
